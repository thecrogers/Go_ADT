The Purpose of this project it so make a simple mostly recursive Go Lib that has several ADT that my be used as individual packages, or as one large package.

CURRENT Progress: 
Single Linked List

The goal implementation will look something like one of the following



```go
import	github.com/thecrogers/Go_ADT/

   type Some struct {
     someDate 	   string
     someOtherDate int
   }

   myList :=  ADT.SingleList{ *Some }

   var myData Some{ "new data", 5 }
   myList.Add(myData)

   result :=  myList.Find(Some.someOtherData, 5)
```

Or

```go
import github.com/thecrogers/Go_ADT/ADT/SingleLinkedList

type data struct {

}

SLL := SingleLinkedList.newAdt()
dataVar data{

}
SLL.AddStart(id, dataVar )
```


I have also included a go test file for each type that I will use to verify each method of the ADT functions as expected.
